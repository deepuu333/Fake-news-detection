The first file named “True.csv” contains more than 12,600 articles from reuter.com. The second file named “Fake.csv” contains more than 12,600 articles from different fake news outlet resources. Each article contains the following information: article title, text, type and the date the article was published on. To match the fake news data collected for kaggle.com, we focused mostly on collecting articles from 2016 to 2017.
